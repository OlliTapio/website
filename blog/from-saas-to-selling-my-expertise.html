        <h1>From SaaS to Selling My Expertise</h1>
        <p class="blog-meta">April 17, 2025</p>

        <div class="content">
          <p>This article chronicles my transition from startup founder to independent consultant. After leaving my startup, I initially wanted to build a SaaS product but struggled identifying problems worth solving. A mentor suggested an alternative: start by selling my expertise through consulting.</p>

          <h2>Initial Challenges</h2>
          <p>I first attempted selling expertise to accountants but didn't truly understand the real problems accountants faced daily. This led to failed outreach attempts.</p>

          <h2>Strategic Pivot</h2>
          <p>Upon reflection, I identified genuine expertise areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>IT and infrastructure management in small companies</li>
            <li>Building reporting tools and integrations</li>
            <li>Improving refurbishment operations at Swappie</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Market Selection</h2>
          <p>Rather than pursue general software development, I chose smartphone refurbishment operations—targeting small-to-mid-sized European refurbishers (10-20 employees, €2-20M revenue) facing operational pain points.</p>

          <h2>Sales Approach</h2>
          <p>Two strategies emerged: abstract "optimization audits" failed, while practical, tangible workshops on operational improvements succeeded. The lesson: clients prefer clear, tangible solutions over vague audits.</p>

          <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
          <p>I candidly address sales anxiety here. Rejection sensitivity and lack of team support made independent selling emotionally challenging. Selling has been really hard for me.</p>
          <p>In future posts, I'll share specific sales tactics and lead-generation tools I used.</p>
