          <p>This article chronicles my experience transitioning from building a SaaS product to selling consulting expertise in smartphone refurbishment operations.</p>

          <h2>Market Research & Lead Generation</h2>
          <p>I used multiple tools to identify prospects—LinkedIn Sales Navigator, Apollo.io's free tier, and refurbed.com scraping. ChatGPT assisted with company analysis and translation.</p>
          <p>Despite substantial outreach effort, the results were underwhelming. Out of around 30 contacts, I got two meetings and made one sale. Manual LinkedIn outreach proved time-consuming and felt unsustainable.</p>

          <h2>Market Limitations</h2>
          <p>The refurbishment industry proved too narrow. I discovered that there just aren't that many independent refurbishers in Europe that are big enough to hire external consultants. And profit margins were insufficient to justify consulting fees.</p>

          <h2>Strategic Pivot</h2>
          <p>Rather than focusing on refurbishment-specific problems, I recognized that my expertise transfers to broader operational challenges. Manufacturing and assembly operations share similar inefficiency patterns.</p>
          <p>The evolving challenge: identifying where manufacturing operations expertise creates genuine market pain worth solving.</p>

          <h2>Key Insight</h2>
          <p>Selling expertise requires more than outreach—it demands finding industries where operational problems are both acute and profitable enough to warrant external solutions.</p>
