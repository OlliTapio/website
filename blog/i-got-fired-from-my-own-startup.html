        <h1>I Got Fired From My Own Startup</h1>

        <div class="content">
          <p>I quit a comfortable, well-paying job as an engineering manager to chase my dream of starting a business. A year later, I was fired from my own startup because my co-founders couldn't stand each other.</p>

          <p>I left a comfortable engineering manager position to launch a startup after my daughter was born. I joined an Antler cohort in Finland and partnered with a CEO to build project management software for the legal industry.</p>

          <h2>Initial Development</h2>
          <p>The team initially focused on legal project management but struggled with product-market fit. After months of customer feedback, we pivoted to AI-assisted timekeeping software for lawyers—a solution that resonated better with prospects.</p>

          <h2>Team Conflict</h2>
          <p>Despite the product pivot showing promise, internal tensions escalated between the CEO and CMO. Three core issues emerged:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The CEO's lack of focus and avoidance of investor outreach</li>
            <li>The CMO's frustration with the CEO's dismissive leadership style</li>
            <li>Unresolved team conflicts that undermined collaboration</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>The Breaking Point</h2>
          <p>After the CMO departed, the CEO demanded I commit "100% in or out," eliminating a previously agreed part-time arrangement for parental responsibilities. Unable to balance family obligations with the startup's demands, I was effectively fired for prioritizing my daughter.</p>

          <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Focus on Simple, Lovable, Complete products over feature-heavy MVPs</li>
            <li>Conduct thorough customer interviews</li>
            <li>Prioritize open team communication</li>
            <li>Reconsider VC-backed startups while raising young children</li>
          </ul>
