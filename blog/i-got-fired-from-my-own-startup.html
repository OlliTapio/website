          <p>Hi, I'm Olli. I quit a comfortable, well-paying job as an engineering manager to chase my dream of starting a business. A year later, I was fired from my own startup because my co-founders couldn't stand each other.</p>

          <p>I had always dreamed of being an entrepreneur, but I decided to let others pay for my learning first. Years went by, and I grew comfortable in my engineering career.</p>

          <p>Then two big things happened: I got married, and my daughter was born.</p>

          <p>During our honeymoon in the Seychelles, staying at a five-star resort, I got a taste of luxury my current income couldn't sustain. More importantly, I realized I didn't want to tell my daughter someday that I had dreamed of being an entrepreneur but never had the courage to try.</p>

          <p>So just before she was born, I quit my job. I didn't have a solid plan—just a few vague ideas of what I wanted to do.</p>

          <h2>Joining Antler</h2>
          <p>Shortly after my daughter was born, I was unemployed, and my wife was on parental leave. Spending time with our baby was amazing, but after a couple of months, I joined the first Antler cohort in Finland, as suggested by an old colleague.</p>

          <p>Through Antler, I met our CEO. I really enjoyed working with him, and we researched about thirty ideas before landing on project management software for the legal industry. The problem was clear, but selling was a challenge. Thankfully, the CEO brought in a CMO to handle sales and marketing.</p>

          <p>The CMO nailed the pitch at the investment committee, and we secured funding. Our startup was ready to take off—or so we thought.</p>

          <h2>The Grind Begins</h2>
          <p>Summer was slow in Finland, so I spent a lot of time with my daughter. After the holidays, the real grind began. We set up our office at Maria01, and our CMO booked sales meetings non-stop. However, we faced a problem: our product was too vague. Customers saw potential but weren't sold.</p>

          <p>Looking back, I should have been more proactive in interviewing users, but other "busy work" often felt more urgent. We were also slowed down by lacking clear short-term goals. Still, I chalked it up to the learning process of building something new.</p>

          <h2>Pivoting to AI-Assisted Timekeeping</h2>
          <p>After months of feedback, we pivoted to AI-assisted timekeeping software for lawyers. Billable hours were a major pain point, and our solution clicked with customers. The long-term vision was to evolve into a law firm management platform powered by AI.</p>

          <p>While the pivot brought clarity to our product, cracks in the team became more apparent. Heated arguments dragged on without actionable outcomes. I focused on product development to avoid the conflict or tried to mediate by setting clear goals, but underlying tensions remained.</p>

          <h2>The Issues</h2>
          <p>Balancing startup life and family life was tough. My wife wanted to return to work, but we weren't ready to send our daughter to daycare. We came up with a plan: in a couple of months, I would take care of her two days a week while my wife worked, and I'd focus on the startup outside those hours.</p>

          <p>However, the real problems were within the team:</p>

          <p><strong>The CEO's Role:</strong> The CEO lacked focus and avoided unpleasant tasks, like reaching out to investors. His hesitation hurt our funding efforts.</p>

          <p><strong>The CMO's Frustration:</strong> The CMO wasn't passionate about the project or the CEO. She struggled with his habit of dismissing input, which I should have addressed earlier.</p>

          <p><strong>Team Tensions:</strong> Conflicts between the CEO and CMO escalated, undermining collaboration and productivity.</p>

          <h2>The Breakup</h2>
          <p>At Slush, doubts about the startup came to a head. The CMO told me she wanted to quit. I tried to convince her to stay by suggesting the CEO step down, but her mind was made up.</p>

          <p>After the CMO left, I questioned whether I should stay. Our investor convinced me to keep going, but I got sick shortly after and was bed ridden for a week. During that time, the CEO made it clear: I needed to be "100% in or out." Suddenly, the part-time parental leave arrangement—something everyone had been fine with earlier—was no longer an option.</p>

          <p>With my wife's return-to-work agreed with her employer and no daycare lined up, I had to choose between my family and the company. I also knew the CEO's struggles would resurface. So, I was fired from my own startup—for prioritizing my daughter.</p>

          <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
          <p><strong>Focus on SLC, Not MVP:</strong> Our MVP had too many features. In hindsight, we should have focused on building a Simple, Lovable, Complete product.</p>

          <p><strong>Customer Conversations Matter:</strong> We didn't do enough user interviews or act quickly enough on feedback.</p>

          <p><strong>Team Dynamics Are Critical:</strong> We avoided tough conversations instead of addressing issues head-on. Open communication is essential for success.</p>

          <p><strong>Family First:</strong> Startups demand full commitment, but young children grow up fast. I wouldn't pursue a VC-backed startup again while raising a baby.</p>

          <p>Though my first startup failed, it taught me invaluable lessons about entrepreneurship, leadership, and resilience. I'm more deliberate now about who I work with and the opportunities I pursue. And I wouldn't trade the time I've spent with my daughter for anything.</p>
